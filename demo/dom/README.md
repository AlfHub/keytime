This is a demo of DOM/CSS manipulation with keytime. This subclasses `keytime` to provide a custom interpolator (CSS unit strings like `50px` and `25%`), and also maps property names like `"position"` to a CSS style update.

Some of these modules will make their way into npm as they become more stable.
